## ðŸ“¥ How to Run the Project

1.     Setup Database    

      Install MySQL (or use an existing MySQL server).
      Open your MySQL client or phpMyAdmin.
      Run the script file:

     ```sql
     SOURCE path/to/Cab_booking.sql;
     ```

2.     Explore Tables    

   ```sql
   SHOW TABLES;
   SELECT    FROM Customers;
   ```

3.     Run Analytical Queries    

      Scroll through the script to find queries under different sections.
      Execute them to get business insights.
